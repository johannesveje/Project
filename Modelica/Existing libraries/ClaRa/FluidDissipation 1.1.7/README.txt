Installation
____________


 	1. Unzip the file FluidDissipation 1.1.7.zip. If you have a Dymola licence you
	   should install the library in the subfolder $Dymola\Modelica\Library. It will
	   be listed in the libraries menue of Dymola.
	    
	2. Load the library package.mo into Dymola (File/Open...).

	3. Go to Users guide for more information.


Library description 
___________________
 
This library contains convective heat transfer and pressure loss functions written in 
Modelica. It was developed with Dymola and should be used with this software for
obtaining optimal performance and coverage of Modelica.Fluid examples. 

For the following applications functions are provided:

Heat Transfer

- Channel: even gaps
- General: generic forced convection (e.g., Dittus and Boelter)
- Heat Exchanger: heat transfer for heat exchangers
- Helical Pipe: forced convection within helical pipe heat exchangers
- Plate: forced convection for even surfaces 
- Straight Pipe: heat transfer in straight pipes

Pressure Loss

- Bend: pressure drop for curved or edged bends
- Channel: pressure drop for channel flows
- Diffuser: pressure difference in diffusers
- General: generic pressure drop correlations
- Heat Exchanger: air-side pressure drop for fin and tube heat exchangers, pressure drop 
  for corrugated heat exchangers
- Junction: pressure difference in junctions
- Nozzle: pressure drop in nozzles
- Orifice: pressure difference for a sudden change of hydraulic diameter
- Straight Pipe: pressure drop in straight pipes
- Valve: pressure drop of multiple valve types

The library is a non-commercial product of XRG Simulation GmbH. It makes use of external, 
non-commercial models supplied by Modelica Standard Library. In order to work correctly, 
ensure that this library is always loaded with Modelica Standard Library version 3.2.1.
